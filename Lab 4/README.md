# Ph-UI!!!

Collaboration with Zhenghe Wang zw282 and Ruby Pan dp478.

For lab this week, we focus on both on sensing, to bring in new modes of input into your devices, as well as prototyping the physical look and feel of the device. You will think about the physical form the device needs to perform the sensing as well as present the display or feedback about what was sensed. 

## Part 1 Lab Preparation

### Get the latest content:
As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. As we discussed in the class, there are 2 ways you can do so:

**\[recommended\]**Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the personal access token for this.

```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2021
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab4 content"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

### Start brasinstorming ideas by reading: 
* [What do prototypes prototype?](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-do-Prototypes-Prototype-Houde-Hill/30bc6125fab9d9b2d5854223aeea7900a218f149)
* [Paper prototyping](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/) is used by UX designers to quickly develop interface ideas and run them by people before any programming occurs. 
* [Cardboard prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9Q-KDSb9o) help interactive product designers to work through additional issues, like how big something should be, how it could be carried, where it would sit. 
* [Tips to Cut, Fold, Mold and Papier-Mache Cardboard](https://makezine.com/2016/04/21/working-with-cardboard-tips-cut-fold-mold-papier-mache/) from Make Magazine.
* [Surprisingly complicated forms](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/50032245843343100/) can be built with paper, cardstock or cardboard.  The most advanced and challenging prototypes to prototype with paper are [cardboard mechanisms](https://www.pinterest.com/helgangchin/paper-mechanisms/) which move and change.

## The Report (Part 1: A-D, Part 2: E-F)

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction 

We want to introduce you to the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in your kit. It's one of the most flexible input devices we are able to provide. At boot, it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes, it considers it a user touch. You can attach any conductive material. In your kit, you have copper tape that will work well, but don't limit yourself! In the example below, we use Twizzlers--you should pick your own objects.


<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/cropped_images/000/003/226/medium640/MPR121_top_angle.jpg?1609282424" height="150" />
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/1200x900/4401-01.jpg" height="150">
</p>

Plug in the capacitive sensor board with the QWIIC connector. Connect your Twizzlers with either the copper tape or the alligator clips (the clips work better). In this lab, we will continue to use the `circuitpython` virtual environment we created before. Activate `circuitpython` and `cd` to your Lab 4 folder to install the requirements by:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/679721816318803975/823299613812719666/PXL_20210321_205742253.jpg" width=400>
These Twizzlers are connected to pads 6 and 10. When you run the code and touch a Twizzler, the terminal will print out the following

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python cap_test.py 
Twizzler 10 touched!
Twizzler 6 touched!
```

### Part B
### More sensors

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

We here want you to get to know this awesome sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595). It is capable of sensing proximity, light (also RGB), and gesture! 

<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-03.jpg" width=200>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the three example scripts individually to see what the sensor is capable of doing!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python proximity_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python gesture_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python color_test.py
...
```

You can go the the [Adafruit GitHub Page](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_APDS9960) to see more examples for this sensor!

#### Rotary Encoder

A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position to analog or digital output signals. The [Adafruit rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991#technical-details) we ordered for you came with separated breakout board and encoder itself, that is, they will need to be soldered if you have not yet done so! We will be bringing the soldering station to the lab class for you to use, also, you can go to the MakerLAB to do the soldering off-class. Here is some [guidance on soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/preparation) from Adafruit. When you first solder, get someone who has done it before (ideally in the MakerLAB environment). It is a good idea to review this material beforehand so you know what to look at.

<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/4991-09.jpg" height="200">
</p>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the example script, it comes with an additional button which might be useful for your design!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python encoder_test.py
```

You can go to the [Adafruit Learn Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-qt-rotary-encoder/python-circuitpython) to learn more about the sensor! The sensor actually comes with an LED (neo pixel): Can you try lighting it up? 

#### Joystick

A [joystick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15168) can be used to sense and report the input of the stick for it pivoting angle or direction. It also comes with a button input!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python joystick_test.py
```

You can go to the [SparkFun GitHub Page](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Joystick_Py) to learn more about the sensor!

#### (Optional) Distance Sensor

Note: We did not distribute this sensor to you, so if you are interested in playing with it, please come pick it up from the TA!

Earlier we have asked you to play with the proximity sensor, which is able to sense object within a short distance. Here, we offer [Qwiic Multi Distance Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17072), which has a field of view of about 25° and is able to detect objects up to 3 meters away!

</p>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the example script to see how it works!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python distance_test.py
```

You can go to the [SparkFun GitHub Page](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_VL53L1X_Py) to learn more about the sensor and see other examples!

### Part C
### Physical considerations for sensing

Usually, sensors need to positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for their application. Now that you've tried a bunch of the sensors, pick one that you would like to use, and an application where you use the output of that sensor for an interaction. For example, you can use a distance sensor to measure someone's height if you position it overhead and get them to stand under it.

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches of different ways you might use your sensor, and how the larger device needs to be shaped in order to make the sensor useful.\*\*\***

We picked the capacitive sensor as our sensor for interaction design.

![1](./diagrams/partc_1.jpg)
![2](./diagrams/partc_2.jpg)
![3](./diagrams/partc_3.jpg)

1. Whack a fruit game

    This game is designed to resemble the Whack a mole game, where players smash the mole when it pops up. In this case, the player will be looking at the screen and smash the correct fruit to score. 

2. Finger dance game 

    The finger dance game uses five physical buttons: up, down, left, right, and spin to guide the move of the avatar on the screen. Players will push the buttons according to the screen’s hint, where the directions will float on the screen from the left to the right. The avatar will dance to the music and generate scores. 

3. Car racing game 

   In this game, players will be driving the car using the controller enabled by the sensor. There will be buttons for turning left and right and also drifting. 

4. Animal band - make your acapella

    In this game, users will be playing with different character buttons to make their own beats. Each button will produce a different sound associated to the character once pressed. For example, the frog sound might be used as the high-hat, and the kitten will produce a “meow” sound. Users can record the beats and play it again. 

5. Restroom control system 

    The device will work as a remote control in this case. Users can turn on and off the bathroom light, the ventilation system, and also adjust the temperature using the buttons.


**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

1. Whack a fruit game 

    From our sketch, we found that we will have to include a larger screen to show where the fruits pop up so the player can see clearly, since we wanted the physical touching board to resemble the actual whack a mole game (eg. in 3 * 3 grids). This might be hard to operate unless we use a larger monitor for displaying. In physical prototyping, we will also have to make the fruit “smashable” by using plastic fruit models. 
    
2. Finger dance game 

    One question we thought about was the alignment of the buttons. From the sketch, we found that instead of putting the buttons in fixed places and sequences, it might be more user-friendly if players can place the buttons as they wish. For example, some players might want the buttons to be mounted on the walls while others might want to hold the buttons. Another thing we noticed was the size of the buttons. Will users enjoy it more as a finger dance game or a whole-body exercise like the dancing machine they can use at home? 

3. Car racing game 

    For the car racing game, we wanted to know if we can successfully assemble a mini controller that holds different buttons together, and can detect whether different buttons were pressed. In prototyping, we will have to try out if the sensor can work when different buttons are placed close to each other, or connected together on a plastic surface.

4. Animal band 

    In this case, one thing we wanted to explore is if there will be time lags and delays between when the buttons are pressed and the sound is made from the speaker. Because we wanted to make it a melodic game, we will have to make sure that there will be minimum time lags so that the user can try out and create the beat smoothly. We also wanted to see if we should group the buttons or let the users try out the buttons that produce different sounds in a random order. For example, we group animals that produce the drum sounds and others that produce melodies. 

5. Restroom control system 

    For the restroom control system, we were wondering how we could connect the remote to the devices in the restroom without cables. It would require us to establish wireless connections between the devices and our pi first. 


**\*\*\*Pick one of these designs to prototype.\*\*\***

We picked "Animal Band".


### Part D
### Physical considerations for displaying information and housing parts


Here is an Pi with a paper faceplate on it to turn it into a display interface:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/paper_if.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>


This is fine, but the mounting of the display constrains the display location and orientation a lot. Also, it really only works for applications where people can come and stand over the Pi, or where you can mount the Pi to the wall.

Here is another prototype for a paper display:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/b_box.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Your kit includes these [SparkFun Qwiic OLED screens](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153). These use less power than the MiniTFTs you have mounted on the GPIO pins of the Pi, but, more importantly, they can be more flexibily be mounted elsewhere on your physical interface. The way you program this display is almost identical to the way you program a  Pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/6/1/3/5/17153-SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Display__0.91_in__128x32_-01.jpg" height="200" />
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/679466987314741338/823354087105101854/PXL_20210322_003033073.jpg" height="200">
</p>


It holds a Pi and usb power supply, and provides a front stage on which to put writing, graphics, LEDs, buttons or displays.

This design can be made by scoring a long strip of corrugated cardboard of width X, with the following measurements:

| Y height of box <br> <sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Z  depth of box <br><sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Y height of box  | Z  depth of box | H height of faceplate <br><sub><sup>* * * * * (don't make this too short) * * * * *</sup></sub>|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 

Fold the first flap of the strip so that it sits flush against the back of the face plate, and tape, velcro or hot glue it in place. This will make a H x X interface, with a box of Z x X footprint (which you can adapt to the things you want to put in the box) and a height Y in the back. 

Here is an example:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/horoscope.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Think about how you want to present the information about what your sensor is sensing! Design a paper display for your project that communicates the state of the Pi and a sensor. Ideally you should design it so that you can slide the Pi out to work on the circuit or programming, and then slide it back in and reattach a few wires to be back in operation.
 
**\*\*\*Sketch 5 designs for how you would physically position your display and any buttons or knobs needed to interact with it.\*\*\***

We chose "Animal Band" to prototype.

![1](./diagrams/partd_1.jpg)
![2](./diagrams/partd_2.jpg)
![3](./diagrams/partd_3.jpg)
![4](./diagrams/partd_4.jpg)
![5](./diagrams/partd_5.jpg)

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

Here are the main questions we had:

- Do we want to encourage teamwork or individual experience? If we allow multiple players to play, how do we place the four cables connecting to the "animals"? Do we have them all on the same side or different sides?
- How much leeway do we want the cables to have with the animals?
- How do we represent the animals? Do we use cardboards with figures on them or just write the animal name down?
- Should there be a display? 

**\*\*\*Pick one of these display designs to integrate into your prototype.\*\*\***

We picked the fifth design to integrate into our prototype.

**\*\*\*Explain the rationale for the design.\*\*\*** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)

We picked the fifth design for the following reasons:

- We want to allow users to play with their friends. So we put each cable on a different side. This way, the players could sit around a table and easily reach for their own cable/animal. Also, the speaker, display, and buttons are placed on the top side so that everyone can hear/see/control.
- We want the cables to be as long as possible because the players could be sitting apart from each other depending on where they are playing.
- We decided on a round cardboard with written animal names on them. Printing/drawing different figures would take too much time. Further polishing could be done later on in the prototyping process.
- There should be a display. This way, it is clear to the user whether or not they have successfully pressed the record button. The display can also tell them if there is a recorded piece to play.

Build a cardbord prototype of your design.

**\*\*\*Document your rough prototype.\*\*\***

LAB PART 2

### Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.

### Part E (Optional)
### Servo Control with Joystick

In the class kit, you should be able to find the [Qwiic Servo Controller](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16773) and [Micro Servo Motor SG51](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2201). The Qwiic Servo Controller will need external power supply to drive, which we will be distributing the battery packs in the class. Connect the servo controller to the miniPiTFT through qwiic connector and connect the external battery to the 2-Pin JST port (ower port) on the servo controller. Connect your servo to channel 2 on the controller, make sure the brown is connected to GND and orange is connected to PWM.

<img src="https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/245605956_303690921194525_3309212261588023460_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ae9488&_nc_ohc=FvFLlClTKuUAX9nJ3LR&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.xx&oh=b7ec1abc8d458b6c1b7a00a6f11398ac&oe=618D7D96" width="400"/>

In this exercise, we will be using the nice [ServoKit library](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver/python-circuitpython) developed by Adafruit! We will continue to use the `circuitpython` virtual environment we created. Activate the virtual environment and make sure to install the latest required libraries by running:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

A servo motor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position. The position of a servo motor is set by the width of an electrical pulse, that is, we can use PWM (pulse-width modulation) to set and control the servo motor position. You can read [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-14-servo-motors/servo-motors) to learn a bit more about how exactly a servo motor works.

Now that you have a basic idea of what a servo motor is, look into the script `qwiic_servo_example.py` we provide. In line 14, you should see that we have set up the min_pulse and max_pulse corresponding to the servo turning 0 - 180 degree. Try running the servo example code now and see what happens:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python servo_test.py
```

It is also possible to control the servo using the sensors mentioned in as in part A and part B, and/or from some of the buttons or parts included in your kit, the simplest way might be to chain Qwiic buttons to the other end of the Qwiic OLED. Like this:

<p align="center"> <img src="chaining.png"  width="200" ></p>

You can then call whichever control you like rather than setting a fixed value for the servo. For more information on controlling Qwiic devices, Sparkfun has several python examples, such as [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-joystick-hookup-guide/all#python-examples).

We encourage you to try using these controls, **while** paying particular attention to how the interaction changes depending on the position of the controls. For example, if you have your servo rotating a screen (or a piece of cardboard) from one position to another, what changes about the interaction if the control is on the same side of the screen, or the opposite side of the screen? Trying and retrying different configurations generally helps reveal what a design choice changes about the interaction - make sure to document what you tried_!
